# BeetNFT

Using Hardhat and JS to create my own a BeetleJuice NFT. 

Alchemy --> Coinbase Wallet --> OpenSea 

Used the Ropsten ETH network for live testing before deployment

https://faucet.ropsten.be/ = Faucet used to send fake ETH to Coinbase Wallet account 

⚠️ ETH ROPSTEN FAUCET NOT WORKING!!! ⚠️
