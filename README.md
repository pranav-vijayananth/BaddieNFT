# BeetNFT

Using Hardhat and Solidity to create my own a BeetleJuice NFT. 

Alchemy --> Coinbase Wallet + MetaMask (secondary wallet) --> OpenSea 

Used the Ropsten ETH network for live testing before deployment

https://faucet.ropsten.be/ = Faucet used to send fake ETH to Coinbase Wallet account

👷 Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software.
